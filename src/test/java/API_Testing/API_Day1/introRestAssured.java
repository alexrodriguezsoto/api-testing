public class introRestAssured {
// Rest Assured is a Java library class that is used to perform automated API tests which
// uses gherkin BDD style statements such as given, when, then, and, etc to write such tests.
// Rest Assured has methods to fetch data from response when making requests from a JSON structure.
// Rest Assured works with HTTP request methods such as GET(read), POST(create), PUT(update) and DELETE(delete);
// but as a tester you'll mainly use GET to request data from a server, and POST to create data to a server.
// Testers mostly read or create data and for that purpose GET and POST is used, PUT and DELETE will only be used when needed.
//
// NOTE: As testers, We will only work REST API because it supports Json, xml, and text formats, but Json will be our
// primary source used for testing REST API with REST-assured.
//
// Most often used methods from Rest-Asssured library when writing tests
// To make requests:
//     given() --> used to prepare the request
//     when() and get() or just when() --> used to send the request
//     then() --> used to verify the request
// To verify responses:
//     prettyPeek() --> used to print the response
//     prettyPrint()
//     log() --> logs(prints) all the response
//     asString() --> used to print in String format
//     contentType() --> used to verify body response header is in Json or XML format when using POST request.
//     accept() --> used to verify body response header when making a GET request
//
//     In order to make a request we need to identify the baseURI
//     baseURI --> saves the base URL for all resources
    public static String baseURI = "https://api.octoperf.com";

    // When we make requests, we only provide the path(endpoint) to a specific base resource(url)
    private String path = "public/users/login"; // /public/users/login is our path that will be attached to the base url

    // Therefore, FULL URL/endpoint will be --> https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login

    /* What is an endpoint?
    An endpoint is a unique URL that represents an object or collections of objects.
    For instance, http://www.google.com/search?source=book
                    Base URI       / resource ? parameter
    */

    /*
    We have two different parameter types in API:
    Path param --> will be part of URL separated by single / slash attached to base URL
    Ex: https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login/, where /public/user/login was attached to the baseURI

    Query/Request param  --> is NOT part of the url and it's passed in Key and Value format right after ?
    Ex: https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login?password=test12&username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com
    ? --> means end of url, after that it's (key and value) query/request parameter, you can add multiple query params
    by addin & between them.
    Ex: Query Parameter : password=test12 & username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com
    where key is 'password' and value is 'test12' and so on.
