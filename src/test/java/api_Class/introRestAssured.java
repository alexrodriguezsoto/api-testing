public class introRestAssured {
// Rest-Assured is a library class that uses gherkin BDD style statements such as given, when, then, and, etc
// Rest-Assured works with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations, but as a tester you mainly perform
// GET to request response from a server, and POST to create information to a server.
// Testers mostly use and GET and POST, PUT and DElETE will only be used when needed.

// Most often used methods from Rest-Asssured library:
    // given() --> used to prepare the request
    // when() and get() or just when() --> used to send the request
    // then() --> used to verify the request
    // prettyPeek() --> used to print the response
    // log() --> logs(prints) request from response
    // asString() --> used to print in String format
    // contentType() --> used to verify body response as Json or XML format, but we'll only work with json.

    // In order to make a request we need to identify the baseURI
    // baseURI --> saves the base URL for all resources
    public static String baseURI = "https://api.octoperf.com/public/users";

    // When we make requests, we only provide the path(endpoint) to a specific base resource(url)
    private String path = "/login"; // login is our path (endpoint) that will be attached to the base url

    // Therefore, FULL URL will be --> https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login for now

    /*
    We have two different parameter types in API:
    Path param --> will be part of url followed by the end of full resource url
    Ex: https://api.octoperf.com:443/public/users/login/, separated by single / slash
    Query/Request param  --> is not part of the url and it passed in Key and Value format.
    Ex: https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login?password=test12&username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com
    ? --> means end of url, after that it's (key and value) query parameter.
    Ex: Query Parameter : password=test12 and username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com, where key is password and value is test12 and so on.
     */

    /* What is an endpoint?
    An endpoint is a unique URL that represents an object or collections of objects.
    For instance, http://www.google.com/search?source=book
                  Base URI  / resource ? parameter
    We can see that search is the endpoint
    */

    Base url : https://api.octoperf.com

    When verifying the response header, there are two ways to do it:
    accept --> used when making a GET request to verify the header that I'm receiving should be in json or xml format such as (application/json)
    ContentType() --> used when sending a POST request to check what I'm sending should be in json or xml format
    Note: As testers we mostly work with json format because it's used primarily to transmit data between a server and a web application.
    json stands for JavaScript Object notation, and is a format that is in key and value.
    xml stands for Extensible markup language
