// Rest-Assured is a class that uses gherkin BDD style statements such as given, when, then.
// Rest-Assured works with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations, but as a tester you mainly perform
// GET to request response from a server, and POST to send or create information to/from a server.
// Testers mostly use and GET and POST, PUT and DElETE will only be used when needed.

// These are the most used restAssured methods:
    // given() --> used to prepare the request
    // when() and get() or just when() --> used to send the request
    // then() --> used to verify the request
    // prettyPeek() --> used to print the response
    // asString() --> used to print in String format
    // contentType() --> used to verify body response as Json or XML format, but we'll only work with json.

    // In order to make a request we need to identify the baseURI
    // baseURI --> saves the base url for all resources
    public static String baseURI = "https://api.octoperf.com/public/users";

    // When we make requests, we only provide the path(endpoint) to a specific base resource(url)
    private String path = "/login"; // login is our path (endpoint)

    // Therefore, FULL URL will be --> https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login for now

    /*
    We have to types of parameters as follows:
    Path param --> is part of the url. Ex: https://api.octoperf.com:443/public/users/login/, separated by single / slash
    query/request param  --> is not part of the url. Ex: https://api.octoperf.com/public/users/login?password=test12&username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com
    ? --> means end of url, after that it's (key and value) query parameter.
    Ex: Query Parameter : password=test12 and username=tla.jiraone@gmail.com, where key is password and its value test12 and so on.

    When verifying the response header, there are two ways to do it as follows:
    accept() --> used when making a GET request, verify that header that I'm getting from a server is in application/json or application/xml format.
    ContentType() --> used when sending a POST request, verify that I'm sending json or xml data format to the server and the server needs to accept, if not
    the server will response a default response back.
    Note: As testers we mostly work with json format because it's easy it works with our framework. XML is a more complex format to work with that is
    why companies used mostly json to work when working with API. For interview when they ask about headers, just tell them that I only work with accept
    and contentType to verify headers, that's all.
